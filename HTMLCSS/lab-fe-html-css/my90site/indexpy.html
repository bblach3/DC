    <h1>The Role Playing Game</h1>

    <br>
    <h3>Below is the latest project we worked on in our DigitalCraft cohort. It is a text based role playing game written entirely in Python
        programming language. For someone who has never written a progrmming code, this was a very challenging task for me but with 
    a lot of help received in the beginning I was able to finish it myself. The game has heros who fight the enemies like Goblin, Wizard, or Dragon,
    each having their own characteristics. Here is how some of the code looks like: </h3>

    <br>
    <p>This is for an enemy called Goblin. It has an attack attribute that relates to his enemies. For example, if it attacks
        a hero called Medic, there is a 20% chance the Medic's health points will increase by 2, as shown in line 184 and 185:

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Then there is the Wizard, another enemy. His uniqe feature is to cast a spell on someone and all of their belongins disappear.
    Here's the code below:

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Speaking of belongins, here is the code that runs the menu portion of the game where heros can purchase specific items.
    The code asks the user (a hero) to input a selection from the menu, like an armor, then it checks whether the hero has
    enough coins, and if it does, adds the specific item's points to the hero's balance:

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
The items that heroes can purchase have specific powers. For instance, SuperTonic adds 10 points the hero's health. The code for 
every item is included for each hero as a separate attribute of each hero's class. Each attribute shows the the cost of the items
where it subtacts the amount of coins from the bounty balance. Bounty is collected when an enemy is killed, and then added to the tally for the hero
to spend. Here's the code for buying the items:

<br>
<br>

<p>When the health points of the "self", where "self" refers to the class of hero or enemy it belongs to, goes below 0,
    the hero dies and the game ends, as shown in the code below:
