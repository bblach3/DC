<!-- Exercise 3 -->

<div>
    Here is what I like about lists:
        <ul>
                <li>They are useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
                <li>That's about it</li>
                <li>I'm gonna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>

        </ul>

When you make a list, do it in this order:
        <ol>
                <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
                <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
                <li>
                    Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
                     <ul>
                         <li>Curvebal! you can nest list inside each other</li>
                     </ul>
                </li>
                <li> You've got this, I believe in you!</li>

        </ol>
